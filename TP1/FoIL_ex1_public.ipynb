We advise you to run python notebooks on your browser, for instance using google colab (Watch <a href=\"https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A\">Introduction to Colab</a> to find out more) or our own serveur in epfl (on <a href=\"https://noto.epfl.ch/\">noto.epfl.ch</a>). If you need to refresh your python skills, you may start by our introductory notebooks [here](https://github.com/IdePHICS/FundamentalLearningEPFL2021/blob/main/TP0/Intro%20to%20Python.ipynb) and [there](https://github.com/IdePHICS/FundamentalLearningEPFL2021/blob/main/TP0/Visualization.ipynb).\n","\n","**What you will learn today:** In this first session, we will discuss briefly how to use python, how to use pandas (a powerful, and easy to use, open source data analysis and manipulation tool), and discuss the idea of permutation test and bootstrap, that are amazingly useful concepts from statistics.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"izBv5XTukZth"},"source":["# The Brexit data: who wanted out?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BTGq_uJZkZth"},"source":["\n","We will introduce the concept of permutation test in the hypothesis testing problem exploiting a cool analysis on the Brexit referendum following this great resource https://matthew-brett.github.io/les-pilot/brexit_ages.html.

In fact, you may want to follow an introduction to pandas (for instance [this one](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/), or the very useful [Most Important Pandas Functions for Data Science](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/pandas-functions-13-most-important/)\n",").\n","\n","Here is our problem: The Hansard society made a poll in the 2016 interviewing 1771 people on the Brexit referendum  (data available here https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8183).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pWSuVuGJkZti"},"source":["If we dig into the data, we see that the average age of the \"Brexiteers\" is higher from the one of the \"Remainers\". \n","We are interested in addressing the following question: how $\\textbf{confident}$ can we be that this rule is general and is not an artifact due to low sample size? \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0t4De2E4kZti"},"source":["This problem falls in the broader context of hypothesis testing problem:\n","\n","* Hypothesis (H1) - effective difference in the age of Brexiteers and Remainers \n","                       \n","                         vs \n","                         \n","* \"Null hypothesis\" (H0) - no difference in the age of the two groups\n","\n","This seems like a hard problem but we will see that with a very simple idea we will be able to characterize the answer.
